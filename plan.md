## Project Summary

The current project idea is to analyze the most susceptible cars to theft across different states. We plan on creating a bar graph, categorized by car make, showing the number of thefts within a given period for each car.

## Data Source Ideas

- Car thefts (most susceptible car makes to thefts)(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/2015-vehicle-thefts-by-state-and-make-model)
- Which state has the highest car theft rates(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/uncovering-state-by-state-car-theft-trends-in-20)
- Motor vehicle thefts(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/keremkarayaz/motor-vehicle-thefts)
- Car theft statistics 2024(https://www.marketwatch.com/guides/insurance-services/car-theft-statistics/)
- Car theft stats - Bank Rate(https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/car-theft-statistics/)
